Here are a few case studies showcasing my work with R and Python. Each project includes visualizations and key metrics.

## Case Study 1: Sales Forecasting with Time Series

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

#| fig-cap: "Actual vs. forecasted sales"
set.seed(42)
dates <- seq.Date(as.Date("2023-01-01"), as.Date("2024-12-31"), by = "week")
sales <- 100 + cumsum(rnorm(length(dates), 0, 5)) + rnorm(length(dates), 0, 10)
df <- data.frame(date = dates, sales = sales)

# Simple forecast (naive)
df$forecast <- c(NA, sales[-length(sales)])

ggplot(df[100:120,], aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = sales, color = "Actual")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = forecast, color = "Forecast (naive)"), linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Sales Forecast (sample window)", y = "Sales ($)", x = "Date") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "black", "Forecast (naive)" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()

```
