    "text": "Personal Statement\nData is everywhere, but raw numbers rarely tell the full story. My mission is to bridge the gap between complex data and actionable insights—whether through predictive models, interactive dashboards, or clear visualizations. I’m particularly interested in applications of machine learning in business and social impact. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring data journalism, playing chess, or hiking in Southern California.\n\nCheck out my Data Analytics portfolio to see some of my recent work!"
